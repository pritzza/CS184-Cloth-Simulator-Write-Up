    <blockquote><b>

      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again.

      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? 
      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The lower the spring or “stiffness” constant is, the more the springs stretches. This gives the cloth a looser and more elastic appearance and behavior. Inversely, the higher this constant, the more the cloth retains its original shape and resists deformations. One could imagine that the spring constant is proportional to the thickness of a cloth or fabric which we hope to simulate.

    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The mass of each point mass constituting the cloth is proportional to density. From Newton’s second law that a = F/m. Similar to how the spring constant controls how strong the force which keeps connected masses together, the density does nearly the same exact thing as the former is proportional to acceleration and the ladder is inversely proportional.

    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Damping behaves almost like a control for the amount of air resistance acting on the cloth. Since air resistance is a nonconservative force, without it energy will be conserved and the cloth will sway indefinitely. However with damping present, the more there is the more so this is true: the cloth will globally move slower and converge to its resting position quicker.

    </p>

    <p>
      One can see that with a high stiffness constant, the cloth appears very firm and plastic. On the other hand, with low stiffness, the cloth appears very elastic and droopy, as does when it has relatively high density for reasons explained above.

    <p>
      The difference we see between the cloths when resting on the sphere is due to changes in its stiffness constant. We can observe that the lower the stiffness constant, the more the cloth is deformed by the sphere. In the case where ks = 50,000 the cloth gives less way than compared to when the case where ks = 500.

    <p>
      As described previously, increasing the spring constant gives the cloth the behavior of a stiffer, thicker, less flowy cloth. It has greater structure under its own weight and folds less. Meanwhile increasing the density has the opposite effect. Cloth with greater density folds under itself more.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
Shaders are programs which run on the GPU. The vertex shader is a program which performs computations on the vertex attributes of primitives. This includes computations on the position of vertices, which allows us to transform primitives and their vertices before handing them off to the fragment shader. The fragment shader is responsible for generating fragments for each rasterized pixel of a primitive. It performs all the computations to color/shade the primitives’ pixels in the framebuffer. Together the fragment shader and vertex shader can be used to give the illusion of a realistic 3d scene which is lit and composed of materials that are physically plausible if not accurate. The vertex shader is responsible for transforming the objects of a scene and the fragment shader of the shading and lighting calculations for primitives composing the scene.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is an empirically based shading model which can be best broken down into three components. The ambient component, the diffuse component, and the specular component. The summation of these components describes the shading of just about any object in any scene. The ambient component is supposed to describe all of the indirect light or “ambient” light which illuminates an object. Think how in a dark scene or place there is still some light that manages to get in. The diffuse component corresponds to the light which directly falls on an object from a light source. Finally the specular component tries to capture the “highlights” or shininess of objects. Different configurations of the specular component allow for objects to have sharper or more blurred shiny reflections, which can be used to convey materials which are more or less polished.

    <p>
      Bump mapping and displacement mapping are both techniques that give the appearance of changing the macroscopic roughness of a material’s surface. Both change how the shading on an object appears but it is only displacement mapping which actually changes the vertex positions, or the global position of the original geometry which the mapping is applied to. Unfortunately displacement mapping couldn’t be successfully implemented on my machine; my implementation couldn’t be made to work on my machine, or nor could TAs get my code to run on their machines. Understanding what bump mapping and displacement mapping do, we know that bump mapping has no effect on the underlying geometric data of a mesh, this changing the coarseness of a sphere has little observable effect on appearance of the fragments making up its surface. However displacement mapping translates the positions of each vertex, thus changing the resolution of a mesh would yield visually distinct results, with a coarser mesh being more jaggy and a higher resolution being smoother.
